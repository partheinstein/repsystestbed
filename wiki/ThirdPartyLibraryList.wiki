The following is:
  * A list
  * Of bulleted items
    # This is a numbered sublist
    # Which is done by indenting further
  * And back to the main bulleted list

 * This is also a list
 * With a single leading space
 * Notice that it is rendered
  # At the same levels
  # As the above lists.
 * Despite the different indentation levels.
